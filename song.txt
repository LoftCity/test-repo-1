It's the way you move
It's the way you move, ooh, ooh
I knew I would stay with you after just one touch
The way you move has got me stuck

Ram-dam, da-da-da, dam-dam, ba-da-da-da-da
Ram-dam, ba-da-da, ram-dam-dam
Ram-dam, da-da-da, dam-dam, ba-da-da-da-da
Ram-dam, da-da-da, ram-dam-dam (away, let's go)

It's the way you move
It's the way you move, oh-oh
I knew I would stay with you after just one touch
The way you move has got me stuck
